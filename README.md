# FOG OF WAR

Hello, this is a research project of Fog of War implementation in an RTS game. It is made for the Bachelor degree in Game Development and Design in CITM, UPC.

## What is Fog of war?

Fog of war is a term that refers to describe the uncertainty in situation awareness experienced for militars in military operations. However, in video games, the fog of war reffers to giving the player partial information of a certain area, which makes the player re-think the strategy of the gameplay taking in account the leaking information. 

## Early stages

The earliest use of fog of war was in the 1977 game Empire by Walter Bright, and in 1978 in the game Tanktics from Chris Crawford. Later on, in 1982, he said "limit[ing] the amount of information available to the human player" to compensate for the computer's lack of intelligence.
From this moment, games like Age of Empires started to add this functionality and more advanced features, like hidden effects.
